## TypeScript & Composite Projects

Every package extends `tsconfig.base.json` which sets `composite: true`. The root `tsconfig.json` lists all packages as project references. This means:

- **Always typecheck from the root** — run `pnpm run typecheck` (which runs `tsc --build --emitDeclarationOnly`). This builds the full dependency graph so that cross-package imports resolve correctly. Running `tsc` inside a single package will fail if its dependencies haven't been built yet.
- **`emitDeclarationOnly`** — we only emit `.d.ts` files during typecheck; actual JS bundling is handled by esbuild/tsx/vite...etc, not `tsc`.
- **Project references** — when package A depends on package B, A's `tsconfig.json` must list B in its `references` array. `tsc --build` uses this to determine build order and skip up-to-date packages.

## Root Scripts

- `pnpm run build` — runs `typecheck` first, then recursively runs `build` in all packages that define it
- `pnpm run typecheck` — runs `tsc --build --emitDeclarationOnly` using project references

## Packages

### `artifacts/api-server` (`@workspace/api-server`)

Express 5 API server. Routes live in `src/routes/` and use `@workspace/api-zod` for request and response validation and `@workspace/db` for persistence.

- Entry: `src/index.ts` — reads `PORT`, starts Express
- App setup: `src/app.ts` — mounts CORS, JSON/urlencoded parsing, routes at `/api`
- Routes: `src/routes/index.ts` mounts sub-routers; `src/routes/health.ts` exposes `GET /health` (full path: `/api/health`)
- Depends on: `@workspace/db`, `@workspace/api-zod`
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — run the dev server
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run build` — production esbuild bundle (`dist/index.cjs`)
- Build bundles an allowlist of deps (express, cors, pg, drizzle-orm, zod, etc.) and externalizes the rest

### `lib/db` (`@workspace/db`)

Database layer using Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL. Exports a Drizzle client instance and schema models.

- `src/index.ts` — creates a `Pool` + Drizzle instance, exports schema
- `src/schema/index.ts` — barrel re-export of all models
- `src/schema/<modelname>.ts` — table definitions with `drizzle-zod` insert schemas (no models definitions exist right now)
- `drizzle.config.ts` — Drizzle Kit config (requires `DATABASE_URL`, automatically provided by Replit)
- Exports: `.` (pool, db, schema), `./schema` (schema only)

Production migrations are handled by Replit when publishing. In development, we just use `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push`, and we fallback to `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push-force`.

### `lib/api-spec` (`@workspace/api-spec`)

Owns the OpenAPI 3.1 spec (`openapi.yaml`) and the Orval config (`orval.config.ts`). Running codegen produces output into two sibling packages:

1. `lib/api-client-react/src/generated/` — React Query hooks + fetch client
2. `lib/api-zod/src/generated/` — Zod schemas

Run codegen: `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen`

### `lib/api-zod` (`@workspace/api-zod`)

Generated Zod schemas from the OpenAPI spec (e.g. `HealthCheckResponse`). Used by `api-server` for response validation.

### `lib/api-client-react` (`@workspace/api-client-react`)

Generated React Query hooks and fetch client from the OpenAPI spec (e.g. `useHealthCheck`, `healthCheck`).

### `lib/object-storage-web` (`@workspace/object-storage-web`)

Client-side object storage upload library using presigned URLs (GCS). Exports:
- `useUpload(options)` — React hook for plain `<input type="file">` uploads: requests presigned URL from backend, then PUTs file directly to GCS. Returns `{ uploadFile, isUploading, progress, error }`.
- `ObjectUploader` — Uppy-based modal component for drag-and-drop uploads (uses `@uppy/dashboard` + `@uppy/aws-s3`).

**Upload flow:** `POST /api/storage/uploads/request-url` (JSON metadata) → PUT to presigned URL → store `objectPath` in DB → serve via `GET /api/storage/objects/{path}`.

### `artifacts/axiomcraft` (`@workspace/axiomcraft`)

AxiomCraft premium PC hardware e-commerce storefront. React + Vite SPA, always dark mode.

**Design:** Brutalist luxury / futuristic noir — #050505 bg, #00F0FF cyan, #F04444 red accent
**Typography:** Space Grotesk (headings), Inter (body), JetBrains Mono (specs/numbers)
**Animations:** Framer Motion scroll-linked reveals, spring micro-interactions, staggered entrances
**State:** Zustand cart store + user store (both persisted to localStorage); TIER_CONFIG (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum)
**Compare store:** `useCompareStore` (Zustand, max 4 items, no persist) → `CompareBar` (floating bottom bar, app-global)
**Recently Viewed store:** `useRecentlyViewedStore` (Zustand persist, max 8, localStorage) → `RecentlyViewedCarousel` on homepage
**Auth:** bcryptjs + express-session; POST /api/auth/register|login|logout|claim-role, GET /api/auth/me

**Multi-Role System:**
- **owner** — full access (migrated from old "admin"). Manages products, branches, access codes.
- **manager** — branch-specific access. Manages product availability/stock/discounts for their assigned branch.
- **user/buyer** — standard customer. Shopping, cart, wishlist, tiers.
- Access codes are generated dynamically by owners in the Dashboard > Access Codes tab.
- Access code format: `AXM-OWN-XXXXXX-YYYY` (owner), `AXM-MGR-SHID-XXXXXX-YYYY` (manager)
- Roles are claimed via POST /api/auth/claim-role with { accessCode }

**Multi-Branch System:**
- Branches table: name, location, contact, managerId, active
- branch_products table: per-product overrides for each branch (available, stock, discount, featured, notes)
- GET /api/branches — all branches (public)
- POST/PUT/DELETE /api/branches/:id — owner only
- GET /api/branches/:branchId/products — products with branch data
- PUT /api/branches/:branchId/products/:productId — update branch product (owner or branch manager)
- GET /api/products/:productId/branches — branch availability for a product

**Dashboards:**
- /dashboard — Owner Panel (Products, Branches, Access Codes tabs). Product form has `ProductImageField` component: inline URL input + Upload button (uses `useUpload` from `@workspace/object-storage-web`). File uploads go to GCS via presigned URL; the resulting `/api/storage/objects/…` URL is auto-populated into the form.
- /manager — Manager Panel (branch product management for their assigned branch)

**Navbar:** Dropdown menus (Hardware → categories, Tools → PC Builder/Compare/Deals), user dropdown with tier badge, search overlay, animated cart badge, mobile slide-over. Shows "Dashboard" for owners, "My Branch" for managers.
**API patterns:** API_BASE = `import.meta.env.BASE_URL.replace(/\/$/, "") + "/api"`; Product images: `https://picsum.photos/seed/{slug}/800/600`
**After DB schema changes:** rebuild declarations: `cd lib/db && pnpm exec tsc -p tsconfig.json`
**Seed:** `pnpm --filter @workspace/scripts run seed` — populates 6 categories, 20 hardware products

### `scripts` (`@workspace/scripts`)

Utility scripts package. Each script is a `.ts` file in `src/` with a corresponding npm script in `package.json`. Run scripts via `pnpm --filter @workspace/scripts run <script>`. Scripts can import any workspace package (e.g., `@workspace/db`) by adding it as a dependency in `scripts/package.json`.

- `pnpm --filter @workspace/scripts run seed` — seeds AxiomCraft database with hardware products
